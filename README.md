# Project2-Applied-ML

Members: Lars Bosch, Philipp Brückelt and Thomas Engl

This project contains the code for a self-written neural network. We analyze its performance on Regression tasks, in particular the Runge and Rastrigin function, and on the MNIST dataset as classification task

The used packages can be found in the requirements.txt file and can get installed through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

# Structure:

Code/compute.py: Computes all regression tasks and creates plots

Code/datasets.py: Generate all data for regression tasks

Code/mnist_functions.py: Computes all tasks and creates plots regarding MNIST

Code/mnist_run.ipynb: Runs all tasks regarding MNIST

Code/neural_network.py: Contains a class with the neural network implementation

Code/optimizers.py: Contains all needed optimizers

Code/regression_run.ipynb: Runs all regression tasks

Code/test_custom_netzwork.ipynb: TBA and perhaps rename

Code/test_gradients.py: Pytest to test the manual derivates in the backpropagation
